# Task-Manager
My goal was to create a minimalistic Task Manager with my current knowledge.

##Tech used
-MongoDB
-Mongoose
-EJS
-CSS
-HTML
-Bulma Framework

#Installation Instructions
-First go onto the site and it will direct you to create a user
-After user is created It will ask you to create a new task
-Once you create a new task it will go back to your home page where you can view all your tasks
-Then when you click one "details" of a task you can edit or delete the task.
-Its as simple as that!!!

#User Stories
-User 1: Plans on using this occasionally as a way to track their daily tasks, such as a grocery list, house chores, and meetings.
-User 2: Will use this for class! Keeping track of in class assignements and homework!
-User 3: Will use this as a way to keep up to date with their professional workflow.

##Unsolved Problems
-I was unable to figure out how I could user the user ID within a link across both controllers. I wanted to be able to take them back to the home page(index). 
-I want to also add a "log in" feature which checks for the users username within the database then checks for their password. If the password exists it logs them in.
